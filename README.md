= OSM Merge
The main purpose of this project is to allow users to merge the content on one OpenStreetMap project into another.
Some examples would be:
 * Merging Public Domain Data from the [USGS National Map Corps](http://navigator.er.usgs.gov) system into OpenStreetMap
 * Merging data from compatible datasets that do not conflate well
